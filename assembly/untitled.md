# test

The TEST instruction performs an implied AND operation between corresponding bits in the two operands and sets the flags without modifying either operand. 

 The format for the TEST instruction is: 

`TEST reg, reg` 

`TEST reg, mem` 

`TEST reg, immed` 

`TEST mem, reg` 

`TEST mem, immed` 

reg, mem, and immed can be 8, 16, or 32 bits.
